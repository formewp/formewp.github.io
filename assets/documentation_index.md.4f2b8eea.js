Clients love it - its ubiquity and familiarity makes it the defacto CMS of choice for a vast amount of projects, from mom and pop outfits right up to enterprise level.</p><p>However, a lot of WordPress code is stuck in a bygone era of clunky workflows, bad procedural patterns, weird antiquated syntax, and a tendency towards unmaintainable and untestable spaghetti awfulness. And don&#39;t even get us started on the loop, which is just... wrong. ðŸ¤¢</p><p>If you&#39;ve done any amount of work in modern PHP frameworks such as Laravel or Symfony, you will want to bring similar patterns and best practises to bear on WordPress projects, but it isn&#39;t really designed to support those out of the box.</p><p>Forme aims to solve these pain points.</p><p>There are a bunch of really cool Open Source projects already operating in this space, including <a href="https://lumberjack.rareloop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LumberJack</a>, <a href="https://timber.github.io/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Timber</a>, <a href="https://framework.themosis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Themosis</a> and the <a href="https://roots.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Roots</a> ecosystem. We&#39;ve taken inspiration and ideas from all of these, but built Forme to follow our own specific and opinionated workflow.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><ul><li>Keep things DRY with a typical MVC pattern</li><li>Eloquent ORM and Phinx DB Migrations</li><li>League Plates 4 views (but Plates 3, Blade or Twig also supported)</li><li>WordPress templates become controllers.</li><li>DI Container</li><li>Flexible routing system</li><li>YAML config for WordPress hooks</li><li>Registry pattern</li><li>Bootstrap 5</li><li>PSR-4 and Composer</li><li>Dotenv</li><li>PSR-7 Requests and Responses</li><li>PSR-15 Middleware</li><li>Debugging Tools</li><li>A full featured code generation cli for easy scaffolding</li><li>Unit, integration and end to end test setup</li></ul><h2 id="what-forme-is-not-a-good-fit-for" tabindex="-1">What Forme is <em>not</em> a good fit for <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-forme-is-not-a-good-fit-for" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What Forme is _not_ a good fit for&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Since Forme relies on Composer/PSR-4 and a custom server setup, publishing plugins or themes to the WordPress store is not currently practical.
