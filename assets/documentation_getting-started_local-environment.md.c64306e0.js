You should have relatively few problems running existing Forme projects in whatever web server environment you use, but things like Forme Codegen might not work quite as expected depending on your precise setup, and there might be other bugs.</p><p>Having said that, the issues we&#39;ve seen tend to be mostly bash and file system related. We <em>have</em> previously got things up and running on Windows 10 using packages like <a href="https://cmder.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cmder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nvm-windows</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cretueusebiu/valet-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">valet-windows</a>. This was with an earlier, alpha version of Forme.</p><p>Your best bet is probably going to be to get everything working within a WSL2 Ubuntu instance. For example, we have got things running smoothly with Ubuntu 18.04 in WSL2 using Forme&#39;s <a href="/documentation/getting-started/docker.html">ketch</a> docker setup. Essentially you need to install and run everything from within the WSL2 instance, and proceed exactly as you would do on a Ubuntu machine. You can run Docker Desktop on your host machine, or install docker within the WSL2 instance.</p><p>Your first step would be getting the above prerequisites in place either natively or within WSL depending on which route you choose. We&#39;ve been using the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chocolatey</a> package manager for native Windows dependencies, and obviously the built in <code>apt-get</code> within Ubuntu WSL.</p><p>To get docker installed, you should take a look at the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> as well as Digital Ocean&#39;s Ubuntu tutorials for <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">docker</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">docker-compose</a>.</p><p>Good luck!</p>`,36)])])}const m=a(s,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
